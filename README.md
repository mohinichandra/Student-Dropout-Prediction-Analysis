# Student-Dropout-Prediction-Analysis-using-Python-and-Power-BI
To predict which students are likely to drop out based on behavioral, performance, and demographic data, and visualize insights using Power BI.

### S - Situation:
An EdTech platform offering online courses faced a dropout rate of nearly 20% among enrolled students. Stakeholders wanted to understand why students were dropping out, identify at-risk learners early, and gain insightful visualizations to make data-driven decisions for improving retention.

### T - Task:
Build a predictive model to classify students based on their likelihood of dropping out, and create an interactive dashboard to help stakeholders visualize dropout patterns by various demographics and engagement metrics.

### A - Action: 
##### Python (Backend Analytics & ML):
1. Cleaned and preprocessed a dataset of 10,000+ students using pandas.
2. Performed EDA with seaborn and matplotlib to identify key dropout drivers (e.g., time spent, education level, engagement).
3. Handled class imbalance using SMOTE.
4. Trained a Random Forest Classifier on student behavioral and demographic data.
5. Evaluated model performance with accuracy score and classification report.

#### Power BI (Dashboard & Visualization):
1. Designed an interactive dashboard with slicers for gender and age bracket.
2. Visualized metrics like dropout rate, average time spent, feedback score, and dropout trends by course.
3. Included charts like: Assignment Completion vs. Engagement, Quiz Score vs. Time Spent, Dropout by Course, Gender, Education Level

### R - Result:
1. Achieved 87% model accuracy in predicting dropout likelihood.
2. Identified high-risk segments like undergraduates and students with low engagement levels.
3. Empowered stakeholders with a dynamic dashboard to monitor KPIs, allowing for data-backed intervention strategies.
4. Helped propose course content revisions and targeted retention efforts, potentially reducing dropout rates.
